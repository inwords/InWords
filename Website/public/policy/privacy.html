        Complete details on each type of Personal Data collected are provided in
        the dedicated sections of this privacy policy or by specific explanation
        texts displayed prior to the Data collection.
      </p>
      <p>
        Personal Data may be freely provided by the User, or, in case of Usage
        Data, collected automatically when using this Service.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unless specified otherwise, all Data requested by this Service is
        mandatory and failure to provide this Data may make it impossible for
        this Service to provide its services. In cases where this Service
        specifically states that some Data is not mandatory, Users are free not
        to communicate this Data without consequences to the availability or the
        functioning of the Service.
      </p>
      <p>
        Users who are uncertain about which Personal Data is mandatory are
        welcome to contact the Owner.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any use of Cookies &ndash; or of other tracking tools &ndash; by this
        Service or by the owners of third-party services used by this Service
        serves the purpose of providing the Service required by the User, in
        addition to any other purposes described in the present document and in
        the Cookie Policy, if available.
      </p>
      <p>
        Users are responsible for any third-party Personal Data obtained,
        published or shared through this Service and confirm that they have the
        third party's consent to provide the Data to the Owner.
      </p>
      <h2>Mode and place of processing the Data</h2>
      <h3>Methods of processing</h3>
      <p>
        The Owner takes appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized
        access, disclosure, modification, or unauthorized destruction of the
        Data.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Data processing is carried out using computers and/or IT enabled
        tools, following organizational procedures and modes strictly related to
        the purposes indicated. In addition to the Owner, in some cases, the
        Data may be accessible to certain types of persons in charge, involved
        with the operation of this Service (administration, sales, marketing,
        legal, system administration) or external parties (such as third-party
        technical service providers, mail carriers, hosting providers, IT
        companies, communications agencies) appointed, if necessary, as Data
        Processors by the Owner. The updated list of these parties may be
        requested from the Owner at any time.
      </p>
      <h3>Legal basis of processing</h3>
      <p>
        The Owner may process Personal Data relating to Users if one of the
        following applies:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Users have given their consent for one or more specific purposes.
          Note: Under some legislations the Owner may be allowed to process
          Personal Data until the User objects to such processing
          (&#34;opt-out&#34;), without having to rely on consent or any other of
          the following legal bases. This, however, does not apply, whenever the
          processing of Personal Data is subject to European data protection
          law;
        </li>
        <li>
          provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an agreement
          with the User and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof;
        </li>
        <li>
          processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to
          which the Owner is subject;
        </li>
        <li>
          processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public
          interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the Owner;
        </li>
        <li>
          processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests
          pursued by the Owner or by a third party.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the specific legal
        basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the
        provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or
        a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.
      </p>
      <h3>Place</h3>
      <p>
        The Data is processed at the Owner&#39;s operating offices and in any
        other places where the parties involved in the processing are located.
      </p>
      <p>
        Depending on the User&#39;s location, data transfers may involve
        transferring the User&#39;s Data to a country other than their own. To
        find out more about the place of processing of such transferred Data,
        Users can check the section containing details about the processing of
        Personal Data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Users are also entitled to learn about the legal basis of Data transfers
        to a country outside the European Union or to any international
        organization governed by public international law or set up by two or
        more countries, such as the UN, and about the security measures taken by
        the Owner to safeguard their Data.
      </p>
      <p>
        If any such transfer takes place, Users can find out more by checking
        the relevant sections of this document or inquire with the Owner using
        the information provided in the contact section.
      </p>
      <h3>Retention time</h3>
      <p>
        Personal Data shall be processed and stored for as long as required by
        the purpose they have been collected for.
      </p>
      <p>Therefore:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Personal Data collected for purposes related to the performance of a
          contract between the Owner and the User shall be retained until such
          contract has been fully performed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Personal Data collected for the purposes of the Owner&rsquo;s
          legitimate interests shall be retained as long as needed to fulfill
          such purposes. Users may find specific information regarding the
          legitimate interests pursued by the Owner within the relevant sections
          of this document or by contacting the Owner.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The Owner may be allowed to retain Personal Data for a longer period
        whenever the User has given consent to such processing, as long as such
        consent is not withdrawn. Furthermore, the Owner may be obliged to
        retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever required to do so for
        the performance of a legal obligation or upon order of an authority.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the retention period expires, Personal Data shall be deleted.
        Therefore, the right to access, the right to erasure, the right to
        rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after
        expiration of the retention period.
      </p>
      <h2>The purposes of processing</h2>
      <p>
        Users can find further detailed information about such purposes of
        processing and about the specific Personal Data used for each purpose in
        the respective sections of this document.
      </p>
      <h2>The rights of Users</h2>
      <p>
        Users may exercise certain rights regarding their Data processed by the
        Owner.
      </p>
      <p>In particular, Users have the right to do the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Withdraw their consent at any time.</strong> Users have the
          right to withdraw consent where they have previously given their
          consent to the processing of their Personal Data.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Object to processing of their Data.</strong> Users have the
          right to object to the processing of their Data if the processing is
          carried out on a legal basis other than consent. Further details are
          provided in the dedicated section below.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Access their Data.</strong> Users have the right to learn if
          Data is being processed by the Owner, obtain disclosure regarding
          certain aspects of the processing and obtain a copy of the Data
          undergoing processing.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Verify and seek rectification.</strong> Users have the right
          to verify the accuracy of their Data and ask for it to be updated or

        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Restrict the processing of their Data.</strong> Users have the
          right, under certain circumstances, to restrict the processing of
          their Data. In this case, the Owner will not process their Data for
          any purpose other than storing it.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>
            Have their Personal Data deleted or otherwise removed.
          </strong>
          Users have the right, under certain circumstances, to obtain the
          erasure of their Data from the Owner.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>
            Receive their Data and have it transferred to another controller.
          </strong>

          used and machine readable format and, if technically feasible, to have
          it transmitted to another controller without any hindrance. This
          provision is applicable provided that the Data is processed by
          automated means and that the processing is based on the User&#39;s
          consent, on a contract which the User is part of or on pre-contractual
          obligations thereof.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Lodge a complaint.</strong> Users have the right to bring a
          claim before their competent data protection authority.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Details about the right to object to processing</h3>
      <p>
        Where Personal Data is processed for a public interest, in the exercise
        of an official authority vested in the Owner or for the purposes of the
        legitimate interests pursued by the Owner, Users may object to such
        processing by providing a ground related to their particular situation
        to justify the objection.
      </p>
      <p>
        Users must know that, however, should their Personal Data be processed
        for direct marketing purposes, they can object to that processing at any
        time without providing any justification. To learn, whether the Owner is
        processing Personal Data for direct marketing purposes, Users may refer
        to the relevant sections of this document.
      </p>
      <h3>How to exercise these rights</h3>

        through the contact details provided in this document. These requests
        can be exercised free of charge and will be addressed by the Owner as
        early as possible and always within one month.
